# Assignments from CSE 310 Compiler course
The 4 assignments are all written in C/C++.

1. In first assignment, we built a scope table for variables
2. In second assignment, we used flex to process C language tokens and insert variables in scope table.
3. In third assignment, we used bison with previous codes to generate parse trees
4. In fourth assignment, we generated assembly code from parse tree which could be run in EMU8086 software.
